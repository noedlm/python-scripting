Problem:
Given a positive integral number n, return a strictly increasing
sequence (list/array/string depending on the language) of numbers,
so that the sum of the squares is equal to nÂ².

If there are multiple solutions (and there will be), return the result with the largest possible values.

decompose(5) => [3,4]
decompose(8) => None
decompose(11) => [1,2,4,10]
